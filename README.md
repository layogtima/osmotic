# 🌊 Osmotic

**A meditative journey of digital absorption and ambient serenity.**

Osmotic is an interactive web-based experience that combines gentle visuals with responsive audio to create a state of digital mindfulness. There is no goal, no winning, and no losing—simply existing within a space of ambient tranquility.

It's my constellation of purposefully peculiar projects that blend technology with audio.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Visit [osmotic.layogtima.com](https://osmotic.layogtima.com)
2. Click "Begin" to start your journey
3. Move your cursor (or finger on touch devices) across the screen
4. Simply exist within the space, absorbing elements at your leisure
5. There is no end—disconnect whenever you feel complete

## ✨ Experience

- **Absorb Elements**: Move your cursor or touch to guide your entity through the space, absorbing luminous elements that drift throughout the environment.
- **Ambient Evolution**: As you absorb elements, the environment subtly responds—colors shift, sounds evolve, and your presence leaves ephemeral trails.
- **Meditative Audio**: Each absorption triggers unique tones based on color harmonics, creating an ever-evolving soundscape unique to your journey.

## 🔊 Audio Experience

Osmotic uses the Web Audio API to create a responsive soundscape that evolves with your interactions:

- Each colored element produces a unique tone when absorbed
- The underlying ambient drone subtly shifts as your entity evolves
- For best experience, use headphones or quality speakers

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- Pure JavaScript with HTML5 Canvas
- Web Audio API for procedural sound generation
- No frameworks or dependencies beyond TailwindCSS for styling
- Mobile and desktop compatible

## 📱 Compatibility

- Modern browsers supporting HTML5 Canvas and Web Audio API
- Works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Touch-enabled for tablets and phones

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Expanded soundscapes and audio evolution
- Additional visual elements and environmental phenomena
- Optional guided meditation modes
- Session recording/replay capabilities

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

Osmotic draws inspiration from the concepts of flow states, ambient music, generative art, and the Japanese philosophy of "Ma" (間)—the meaningful pause or negative space within form.
